# Text-Based Adventure Game

## Project Overview

This is a text-based adventure game where players embark on a journey through a magical world filled with choices, challenges, and surprises. As a First Class student of the Air Force Institute of Technology with strong programming skills, you have the opportunity to create an engaging and immersive game. This README will guide you through the project, explaining its features and how to play the game.


## Features

1. **Game Descriptions:** The game provides vivid descriptions of the player's surroundings, setting the scene and creating an immersive experience.
2. **Player Choices:** Players make decisions by entering choices, typically "1" or "2," to progress through the game.
3. **Randomness:** The game includes random factors, such as enemy encounters and item discoveries, to add an element of surprise and replayability.
4. **Win and Lose Conditions:** The game has conditions for winning and losing, which are influenced by the player's choices and some degree of randomness.
5. **Play Again:** After the game ends, players have the option to start a new game, allowing for multiple playthroughs.   

## Getting Started

To run the game, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-based-adventure-game.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd text-based-adventure-game
   ```

3. Run the game:

   ```
   python adventure_game.py
   ```

## How to Play

1. Read the descriptions to immerse yourself in the game world.
2. Make choices by entering "1" or "2" when prompted.
3. Follow the story, engage in challenges, and explore the world.
4. Try to reach the win condition, but beware of losing conditions.
5. If the game ends, decide whether to play again by entering "y" for yes or "n" for no.

## Code Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `adventure_game.py`: The main Python script that runs the game.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.
- `LICENSE`: The license for the project.

The code is structured with functions for various game events and choices, making it easy to maintain and expand.

## Adding Content

To expand the game, you can:

- Add more descriptive text for different locations and encounters.
- Create new functions to handle additional choices and events.
- Incorporate new win and lose conditions.
- Introduce new randomness, such as different enemy types or item drops.
